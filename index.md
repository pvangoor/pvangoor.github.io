I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow with the Systems Theory and Robotics (STR) group in the school of engineering at the ANU. My research focuses on the development of equivariant systems theory, as well as applications to problems in robotics and control.

I completed my Bachelor of Engineering (Research & Development) (Honours) and Bachelor of Science at ANU in 2018, majoring in Mechatronics and Mathematics respectively. I completed my PhD thesis in February 2022, in which I studied equivariant observer design and its application to problems in visual spatial awareness under the supervision of Robert Mahony at the ANU.
