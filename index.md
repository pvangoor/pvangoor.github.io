## About Me

<!-- ![image](assets/mugshot.jpg =50px){: style="float: left"} -->

<img align='left' style="padding:10px;" src="assets/mugshot.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" width="200"/>

I completed my Bachelor of Engineering (Research & Development) (Honours) and Bachelor of Science at ANU in 2018, majoring in Mechatronics and Mathematics respectively.
In 2017 I worked as a student intern at Data61 at CSIRO in Brisbane.
My engineering honours thesis, which I completed in 2017, looked at non-linear multi-agent system control theory using unit quaternions.

In October 2018 I commenced my PhD in non-linear observer theory under the supervision of Robert Mahony at the ANU.
In my PhD I am researching geometric observers for non-linear control problems, such as SLAM, with a focus on fast and computationally inexpensive implementations on mobile robots.
In this research, I am also looking at novel hardware options for implementing these systems.
