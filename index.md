I am a lecturer at the School of Aerospace, Mechanical, and Mechatronic Engineering (AMME) in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Sydney. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow with the Robotics and Mechatronics (RAM) group at the university of Twente, supervised by Antonio Franchi and supported by the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action of the European Research Council. Before that, I worked as a research fellow in the Systems Theory and Robotics (STR) group at the Australian National University (ANU) on the development of equivariant systems theory and applications to problems in robotics and control. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering (Research & Development) (Honours) and Bachelor of Science at ANU in 2018, majoring in Mechatronics and Mathematics respectively. My PhD was awarded in 2023, in which I studied equivariant observer design and its application to problems in visual spatial awareness under the supervision of Robert Mahony at the ANU.
