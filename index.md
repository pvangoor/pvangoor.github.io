I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow with the Robotics and Mechatronics (RAM) group at the university of Twente, supported by the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action by the European Research Council.
Prior to this, I worked as a research fellow in the Systems Theory and Robotics (STR) group at the Australian National University (ANU) on the development of equivariant systems theory and applications to problems in robotics and control.
I completed my Bachelor of Engineering (Research & Development) (Honours) and Bachelor of Science at ANU in 2018, majoring in Mechatronics and Mathematics respectively. My PhD was awarded in 2023, in which I studied equivariant observer design and its application to problems in visual spatial awareness under the supervision of Robert Mahony at the ANU.
