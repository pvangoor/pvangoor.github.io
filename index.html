  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>
    I completed my Bachelor of Engineer (Reseach & Development) (Honours) and Bachelor of Science at ANU in 2018, majoring in Mechatronics and Mathematics respectively.
    In 2017 I worked as a student intern at Data61 at CSIRO in Brisbane.
    My engineering honours thesis, which I completed in 2017, looked at non-linear multi-agent system control theory using unit quaternions.

    In October 2018 I commenced my PhD in non-linear observer theory under the supervision of Robert Mahony at the ANU.
    In my PhD I am researching geometric observers for non-linear control problems, such as SLAM, with a focus on fast and computationally inexpensive implementations on mobile robots.
    In this research, I am also looking at novel hardware options for implementing these systems.
