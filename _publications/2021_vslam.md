Visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (VSLAM) is a well-known problem in robotics with a large range of applications. This paper presents a novel approach to VSLAM by lifting the observer design to a novel Lie group V SLAM n (3) on which the system output is equivariant. The perspective gained from this analysis facilitates the design of a non-linear observer with almost semi-globally asymptotically stable error dynamics. Simulations are provided to illustrate the behaviour of the proposed observer and experiments on data gathered using a fixed-wing UAV flying outdoors demonstrate its performance.
