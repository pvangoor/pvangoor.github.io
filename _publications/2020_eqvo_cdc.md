Visual Odometry is a core problem in robotics. Recent advances in equivariant systems theory, and the discovery of symmetries for the visual odometry problem, has provided a new perspective that is leading to new algorithms. This paper provides an overview of the geometry of visual odometry problem and an algorithm that results from this perspective.
