This paper proposes an equivariant observer for second order pose estimation of a rigid body. The observer exploits the second order kinematic model and its symmetry group. The observer uses conventional sensors and simple computations that allow it to be run on resource-constrained devices. The observer design is based on the lifted kinematics and we prove its asymptotic convergence property. The performance of the observer is demonstrated in simulation.
