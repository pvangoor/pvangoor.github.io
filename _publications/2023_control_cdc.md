High performance trajectory tracking control of quadrotor vehicles is an important challenge in aerial robotics. Symmetry is a fundamental property of physical systems and offers the potential to provide a tool to design high-performance control algorithms. We propose a design methodology that takes any given symmetry, linearises the associated error in a single set of coordinates, and uses LQR design to obtain a high performance control; an approach we term Equivariant Regulator design. We show that quadrotor vehicles admit several different symmetries: the direct product symmetry, the extended pose symmetry and the pose and velocity symmetry, and show that each symmetry can be used to define a global error. We compare the linearised systems via simulation and find that the extended pose and pose and velocity symmetries outperform the direct product symmetry in the presence of large disturbances. This suggests that choices of equivariant and group affine symmetries have improved linearisation error.
