This paper builds on recent work on Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) in the non-linear observer community, by framing the visual localisation and mapping problem as a continuous-time equivariant observer design problem on the symmetry group of a kinematic system. The state-space is a quotient of the robot pose expressed on SE (3) and multiple copies of real projective space, used to represent both points in space and bearings in a single unified framework. An observer with decoupled Riccati-gains for each landmark is derived and we show that its error system is almost globally asymptotically stable and exponentially stable in-the-large.
