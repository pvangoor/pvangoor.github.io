Recently, I released the code for my feature tracking library, GIFT.
GIFT lets you specify camera parameters, and then it will detect and track features between subsequent images taken by that camera.
All the boilerplate code associated with feature tracking and providing geometric descriptions of image points is taken care of.
For example, a GIFT landmark contains the pixel coordinates (corresponding to the image plane), the normalised coordinates, and the spherical coordinates of a given image point.
I hope GIFT will be useful to others who need to work with tracked features.
An example of the output from GIFT is now available on youtube.
